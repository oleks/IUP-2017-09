  * Like everyone else, like some other people, and like nobody else.
  * How do students react to their educational experiences?

  * Psychology and education.
  * Varied practice, not just repetition.
  * The effect of reward and punishment.
  * Harsh criticism rarely promotes learning.
  * Helpful, understandable comments on work carried out are essential.

  * Maintaining attention: interest or the need to pass exams.
  * Sensory signals -> short-term memory (STM).
  * STM is where sensory signals compete with elements of LTM.
  * STM is 20s 5-9 pieces of information.

  * Episodic LTM: Events or episodes.
  * Semantic LTM: Knowledge and ideas.
  * Filing information for fast recall.
  * Episodic and Semantic LTM are closely linked.
  * LTM is kept under constant review (a bit like science ought to be?).
  * Concepts are formed through varied examples in contrasting circumstances.

  * Alternative versions of a concept for use for different purposes.
  * Explain in a bar vs. explain at a lecture.

  * Rote learning: learning a telephone number - repeat until in LTM.
  * Forcing something into LTM, regardless of what was already in there.
  * Meaningful learning: establishing concepts and linking LTM.

  * "Concept" vs. "organizing idea"
  * Threshold concepts: play a critical role in understanding a topic area.
  * "Salient" vs. "incidental"
  * It is impotant to discern what is salient (Ference Marton).
  * Conception: recognise defining features, and discriminate from similar.
  * Here it is important to experience the variations of the concept.

  * There is a difference between 'discerning' and 'being told'.
  * In discerning we become 'sensitized' to the aspects.
  * Learning depends on experiencing variation (Marton & Tsui, 2004).

  * *Variation theory*
  * Systematically provide salient dimenions of variation within a concept.
  * Students then need an opportunity to see and reflect on these variations.
  * Understanding: active exploration of the interconnections of a concept.

  * "As the scenarios of consciousness fly by, driven by stimuli and drawing
    upon memories of prior scenarios, they are weighted and modified by
    emotion" (Wilson, 1998)

  * Creating an integrated "whole" is satisfying has emotional tone.

  * Where do I find a concrete bibliography for quotes?

* Lesson
  * Most people see computers as precise calculating machines.
  * Computers are not so, in lieau of being designed by humans.
  * Precision has its bounds, and when using computers to accomplish common
    tasks, it is important to be ready to explore, understand, and expand
    these bounds.
