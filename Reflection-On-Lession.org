My personal perspective, in retrospect, is that I attempted to do more than
what was intended. I believed that I had an important, yet dense message to
tell, and did not consider to reduce the complexity of the message.

This showed in the amount of time I would have had to use to organize a _good_
lesson. This would have been the sort of time that is not awarded to us due to
the constraints of the course.  This is not to say that I believe more time
should have been allotted, but more that I realize that I easily let my
ambitions grow, without living up to the constraints.

The positive feedback that I got was on how I could engage with the students,
kickstart a discussion, and keep it going through my body language, use of the
whiteboard, enthusiasm, and thorough responses. This, I believe is a
consequence of my wide-ranging experience as a teaching assistant (small,
interactive lessons). As a lecturer, I did not plan the lesson well enough.

The negative feedback was an inevitable consequence of my overambition: there
was too much material, and the terminology and content was not always
sufficiently simplified to get the whole message across. For similar reasons, I
ended with managing my time poorly. Due to the amount of material I wanted to
cover, I did not make sufficient time for planning out, and timing the course
of the lesson before it stated. Last, but not least, the amount of material I
wanted to cover also resulted in occasional speeding in my speech.
